This repository contains my Small and Intermediate python projects such as Web scraping using beautiful soup, Data Visualisation, Geo coding, Page Ranking, Small scale sql projects and other smaller projects such as calculator using tkinter and other similar stuff.

This Projects are mostly parts of the assignments of the course Python for Everybody by charles severance https://www.py4e.com as well as some random stuff unrelated to the course.
